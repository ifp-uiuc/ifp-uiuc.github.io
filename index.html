            <h4>About Our Group</h4>
            <p>The Image Formation and Processing (IFP) group is a part of Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, led by Professor Thomas Huang. Most of the student members of this group are affiliated with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. </p>
            <p> The work in this lab, as the name implies, is mostly in the areas of generation and processing of images. The activities in this lab include image and video coding (compression), computer vision and research into human/machine interfaces. </p>
            <p> The research of the IFP group takes place in the Image Laboratory. This lab was established under an NSF institutional infrastructure grant, with additional grants from the industry and Beckman Institute. </p>
